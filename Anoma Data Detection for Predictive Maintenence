Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Quality Check: Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
Visualization: Create plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand data distribution and relationships.
Time Series Analysis: Examine trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation.

2. Data Cleaning:
Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values based on analysis.
Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and address outliers using techniques like IQR or
standard deviation.
Data Normalization: Scale numerical features to a common range.

3. Feature Engineering:

Time-Based Features: Create features like time of day, day of week, and time since last anomaly.
Rolling Statistics: Calculate rolling mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.
Differencing: Calculate differences between consecutive values to capture trends.
Domain-Specific Features: Consider domain knowledge to create relevant features.

4. Model Selection:

Consider Algorithms: Explore algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Autoencoders.
Evaluate Performance: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Consider Class Imbalance: If necessary, use techniques like SMOTE or class weights.

5. Model Training:

Split Data: Divide data into training and testing sets.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
Train Model: Fit the selected model to the training data.

6. Model Validation:

Evaluate on Test Set: Assess model performance on unseen data using the chosen metrics.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to improve model generalization.

7. Model Deployment:
